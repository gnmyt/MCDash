## Editing a file

By default, the file manager module shows every file from the server. You can edit the content of each file by clicking on the file name.
This will open a text editor where you can edit the content of the file.

## Deleting a file

You can delete a file by clicking on the trash in the context menu of the file.
Just use a right click on the file to open the context menu.
