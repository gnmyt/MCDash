## Navigating Files

The file manager displays all files and folders in your server directory. Click on folders to navigate into them, and use the breadcrumb navigation at the top to move back up the directory tree.

## Viewing & Editing Files

Click on any file to open it in the built-in editor. VoxelDash supports syntax highlighting for many file types including:

- Configuration files (`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.properties`, `.toml`, `.json`)
- Scripts (`.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`)
- Code files (`.java`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`)
- Text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.log`)

After making changes, click **Save** to write your changes to disk.
