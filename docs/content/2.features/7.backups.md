## Backup List

The backup list shows all available backups with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Date** | When the backup was created |
| **Size** | Total size of the backup file |
| **Contents** | Icons showing what's included in the backup |

The icons next to each backup indicate which parts of the server are included. Hover over the icons to see the specific content types.

## Backup Contents

When creating a backup, you can choose which parts of your server to include:

| Content | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Worlds** | All world folders (overworld, nether, end, custom worlds) |
| **Plugins/Mods** | The plugins or mods folder |
| **Configs** | Configuration files (server.properties, bukkit.yml, etc.) |
| **Everything** | Complete server directory backup |

::alert{type="info" icon="lucide:info"}
Selecting specific content types creates smaller, faster backups. Use "Everything" for complete server snapshots.
::
