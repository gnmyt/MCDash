## Quick Overview

The quick overview provides a quick overview of the current state of the system. It is divided into four sections:

- **CPU-Cores**: Shows the current CPU-Cores assigned to the JVM and the total number of CPU-Cores available on the system.
- **TPS**: Shows the current TPS (Ticks per second) of the system.
- **Memory**: Shows the current memory assigned to the JVM and the total memory available on the system.
- **Disk**: Shows the current disk space assigned to the JVM and the total disk space available on the system.

## Quick Control
