## Real-Time Output

The console displays your server's output in real-time using WebSocket connections. You'll see all server messages including:

- Player join/leave notifications
- Chat messages
- Plugin/mod messages
- Server errors and warnings
- Command responses

The console automatically scrolls to show the latest messages. You can scroll up to view older logs.

## Sending Commands

To send a command to the server:

1. Type your command in the input box at the bottom
2. Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button

::alert{type="info" icon="lucide:info"}
You don't need to include a leading slash (`/`) when typing commands. MCDash will execute them directly on the server console.

### Command Examples

```
say Hello, players!
give Steve diamond 64
tp Steve 0 100 0
weather clear
time set day
```

## SSH Access

For advanced users, MCDash also provides SSH access to the server console. This can be configured in the settings and allows you to connect using any SSH client.

::alert{type="warning" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
Be careful when running commands that could damage your server. There's no undo for console commands.
