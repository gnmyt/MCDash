        sudo apt install openjdk-20-jre
        ```

    ### Create your server directory

    Create a new directory on your server where you want to store the dashboard. You can create the directory with the
    following command:
    ```bash
    mkdir mcdash
    ```

    Once you've created the directory, you can change into it with the following command:
    ```bash
    cd mcdash
    ```

    ### Download the standalone .jar

    Click [here](https://modrinth.com/plugin/mcdash) to download the standalone .jar file. Once you've downloaded the
    file, you have to move it to the directory you created earlier.

    ### Create service file

    Create a new service file with the following command:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/systemd/system/mcdash.service
    ```
    Add the following content to the file:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=MCDash
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/mcdash
    ExecStart=/path/to/java -jar mcdash.jar
    Restart=always
    User=root

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/mcdash` with the path to the directory you created earlier and `/path/to/java` with the path 
    to the Java executable.

    ### Start the service

    To start the service, you have to execute the following command:
    ```bash
    systemctl start mcdash
    ```
    To enable the service on startup, you have to execute the following command:
    ```bash
    systemctl enable mcdash
    ```

    ### Access your credentials
    To view your password, you have to view the service logs with the following command:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u mcdash
    ```
